                <h2>Aliexpress</h2>
                <p>AliExpress (Chinese: 全球速卖通) is an online retail service based in China and owned by the Alibaba Group.
                    Launched in 2010, it is made up of small businesses in China and other locations, such as Singapore, 
                    that offer products to international online buyers. It is the most visited e-commerce website in Russia 
                    and was the 10th most popular website in Brazil.[5] It facilitates small businesses to sell to customers
                    all over the world. AliExpress has drawn comparison to eBay, as sellers are independent and use the platform 
                    to offer products to buyers.</p>
