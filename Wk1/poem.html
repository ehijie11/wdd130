    <h1>Nothing Gold can Stand</h1>
        <em>Nature's first green is <em>gold,</em><br>
            Her hardest hue to <em>hold.</em><br>
            Her early leaf's a <strong>flower;</strong><br>
            But only so an <strong>hour;</strong><Br>
        </p>
    <h1>Underface</h1>
    <p>
        Underneath my outside face<br>
        There's a face that none can see.<br>
        A little less smiley,<BR>
        A little less sure,<br>
    </p>
