        <h1>Nothing Gold can Stand</h1>
        <em>Nature's first green is <em>gold,</em><br>
            Her hardest hue to <em>hold.</em><br>
            Her early leaf's a <strong>flower;</strong><br>
            But only so an <strong>hour;</strong><Br>
        </p>

        <h1>Underface</h1>
        <p>
            Underneath my outside face<br>
            There's a face that none can see.<br>
            A little less smiley,<BR>
            A little less sure,<br>
        </p>

        <h1>Life</h1>
        <p>
            Children, ye have not lived, to you it seems<br>
            Life is a lovely stalactite of dreams,<br>
            Or carnival of careless joys that leap<br>
            About your hearts like billows on the deep<br>
            In flames of amber and of amethyst.<br>

            Children, ye have not lived, ye but exist<br>
            Till some resistless hour shall rise and move<br>
            Your hearts to wake and hunger after love,<br>
            And thirst with passionate longing for the things<br>
            That burn your brows with blood-red sufferings.<br>
        </p>
