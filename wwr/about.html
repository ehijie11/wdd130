          <h2>History</h2>
          <img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="History image">
          <p>Early 2000s:
              
              Adventure Rapids Rafting Company was founded by a 
              group of friends who shared a passion for whitewater 
              adventure. Starting with a few rafts and a prime 
              location near River Explorer National Park, they 
              introduced people to the thrill of river rafting.
              Mid-2000s:
              Their reputation grew quickly as they expanded 
              their fleet and hired experienced guides, focusing 
              on safety and enjoyment. They also embraced 
              environmental responsibility, partnering with 
              local conservation groups.
              2010s:
              Adventure Rapids became a top choice for river 
              adventures, offering various rafting experiences. 
              They adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic by 
              implementing safety measures and continued to 
              provide memorable trips.
              Present Day:
              Today, Adventure Rapids is a respected name 
              in rafting. They offer team-building 
              adventures, educational programs, and 
              environmental initiatives, staying true 
              to their mission of sharing the joy of 
              rafting and preserving nature.
