            <p>Early 2000s:
                Zarahemla Rafting Company was founded by a group of friends who shared a passion for whitewater adventure. Starting with a few rafts and a prime location near River Explorer National Park, they introduced people to the thrill of river rafting.
                Mid-2000s:
                Their reputation grew quickly as they expanded their fleet and hired experienced guides, focusing on safety and enjoyment. They also embraced environmental responsibility, partnering with local conservation groups.
                2010s:
                Adventure Rapids became a top choice for river adventures, offering various rafting experiences. They adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing safety measures and continued to provide memorable trips.
                Present Day:
                Today, Zarahemla is a respected name in rafting. They offer team-building adventures, educational programs, and environmental initiatives, staying true to their mission of sharing the joy of rafting and preserving nature.
